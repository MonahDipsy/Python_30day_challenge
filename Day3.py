#Day 3 operators
#addition(+)
#you can add numbers using this symbol
x = 10
y = 7
print(x + y)
print(4+1)
#you can add strings using this symbol...i.e string concantination
print('hello ' + 'World')#will output hello world

#subtraction(-) 
print(x-y)

#Multiplication(*)
print(x * y)
print(4*3)
#you can also multiplie a string with and integer to output the string that number of times
print("hello" * 3) #will output hellohellohello

#power(**)
print(x**y)#will output x raised to the power of y

#Division(/)
print(x/y)
#you can use the double slash to give out only the whole number part of the answer
print(x//y)#will output 1

#modulous(%)
#outputs the remainder
print(x%y)


#logical operations....note that they are not only used on integers but also other data types(strings,lists,sets,tupels)etc.
#equal to (==)
print(x==y)#will output False because they are not equal

#greater than(>)
print(x>y)#will output True because x is greater than y
#greater than or equal to
print(x>=y)

#less than(<)
print(x<y)#will output False because x is not less than y
#less than or equal to (<=)
print(x<=y)

#not equal
print(x!=y)#will output True because x and y are not equal to each other
