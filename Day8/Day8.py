#Tuples
#Tuples are similar to list with the exception that they are enclosed in brackets and that
#Tuples are immutable.....their values cannot be modified
#indexing
x = ('hallo','a',1,'B',56)
print(x[0])#returns hallo
#tuples can contain other tuples in them
y = ('hallo','a',1,'B',56,(23,'howdy'))

#nothing more but just to note that tuples are faster than lists
