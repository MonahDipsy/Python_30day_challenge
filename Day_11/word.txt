Not every user of a single operating system should have the same level of access to files
Signand
Out directories. Like any professional or enterprise­level operating system, Linux has
methods for securing file and directory access. This security system allows the system
administrator—the root user—or the file owner to protect their files from unwanted
access or tampering by granting select users permissions to read, write, or execute files.
For each file and directory, we can specify the permission status for the file’s owner, for
particular groups of users, and for all other users. This is a necessity in a multiuser,
enterprise­level operating system. The alternative would be quite chaotic.
In this chapter, I’ll show you how to check for and change permissions on files and
directories for select users, how to set default file and directory permissions, and how to
set special permissions. Finally, you will see how a hacker’s understanding of
permissions might help them exploit a system.
